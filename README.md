# Finnish Event Planner

## Project summary
    Finnish Event Planner is a simple app that helps people organise and explore local summer events. The focus is on small community-style activities, such as summer BBQs, coding or hobby meetups, outdoor concerts, sauna evenings, and local flea markets or nature walks. 
    Users can add, view, edit, and delete events, and see the weather forecast for the event location.
